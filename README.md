# check_redfish.py

This is a monitoring/inventory plugin to check components and
health status of systems which support Redfish.
It will also create an inventory of all components of a system.

### NetBox import support
You are also able to import the inventory files into [NetBox](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox)
using [netbox-snyc](https://github.com/bb-Ricardo/netbox-sync).

## Requirements
* python >= 3.6
* redfish >= 2.1.4

## Installation

### RedHat based OS
* on RedHat/CentOS you need to install python3.6 and pip from EPEL first
* on RedHat/CentOS 8 systems the package name changed to `python3-pip`
```
yum install python36-pip
```

* download and install plugin
```
cd /usr/lib64/nagios/plugins/
git clone https://github.com/bb-Ricardo/check_redfish.git
cd check_redfish
pip3 install -r requirements.txt || pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Icinga2 and Grafana
Command definitions and a service config example for Icinga2 can be found in [contrib](contrib).
There is also an InfluxDB dashboard for some metrics included.

query inventory information (no health check):
  -i, --inventory       return inventory in json format instead of regular
                        plugin output
  --inventory_id INVENTORY_ID
                        set an ID which can be used to identify this host in
                        the destination inventory
  --inventory_name INVENTORY_NAME
                        set a name which can be used to identify this host in
                        the destination inventory
  --inventory_file INVENTORY_FILE
                        set file to write the inventory output to. Otherwise
                        stdout will be used.

```

## General usage
multiple request commands can be combined. Or use `--all` to query all system information at once

### Let's start with an example
```/usr/lib64/nagios/plugins/check_redfish/check_redfish.py -H 10.0.0.23 -f /etc/icinga2/ilo_credentials --storage --power```
* request BMC: 10.0.0.23
* use credentials from file: /etc/icinga2/ilo_credentials
* query health of: storage, power

### Alternative HTTPS port
If you want to use a different Port then 443 then just add the port to the Host parameter.<br>
Example for Port 8443:
```
-H 127.0.0.1:8443
```

### Authentication
Credentials can be provided in **3** ways and will be checked in following order:
* using --username and --password options (credentials will be exposed in process list)
* using an auth file which includes the credentials
* add credentials to environment

#### Authentication file
An authentication credential file can be provided. The structure looks like this:
```
username=icinga
password=readonlysecret
```

#### Environment variables
these two environment vars will be checked
* CHECK_REDFISH_USERNAME
* CHECK_REDFISH_PASSWORD
```
export CHECK_REDFISH_USERNAME=icinga
export CHECK_REDFISH_PASSWORD=readonlysecret
```

### Sessions and session resumption
To avoid delays due to login on every request and flooding the event log with
login/logout messages a session resumption was implemented. If the session in the
BMC is expired a new session and session file will be created.

**IMPORTANT**<br>
To actually benefit from this feature you need to set the user session timeout in
the BMC to a higher value then your default check interval!

If your default check interval is 5 minutes then the session timeout in the BMC
should be at least 6 minutes!

#### No Session
If no session is required (i.e.: testing, inventory collection) then a `--nosession` can
be added to close session on the BMC properly.

#### Session file name and location
Per default a session file will be crated in the *system/user default temp path*.
These defaults can be changed with following options:

Use ```--sessionfiledir```to define where the session files should be stored.
Use ```--sessionfile``` to specify the name of the session file for this particular system.

#### Example
options like this:

```--sessionfiledir /var/plugin/tmp --sessionfile my-hostname.session```

results in following session file:

```/var/plugin/tmp/my-hostname.session```

### WARNING and CRITICAL (health checks only)
you can use warning and critical with following commands:

**--mel** and **--sel** (values are passed as "days")<br>
define after how many days' event log entries which have a != OK severity shouldn't
be alerted anymore. On most systems it is not possible to set management event log entries
as cleared. So entries with a severity of warning would alarm forever. This way they change
state while they age.

Example: ```--mel --critical 1 --warning 3```

* Entries with a != OK severity which are not older than 24 hours are reported as CRITICAL
* Entries with a != OK severity which are not older than 72 hours are reported as WARNING
* Any entries with a != OK severity which are older than 72 hours will be reported as OK

### Detailed (health checks only)
Health status by default will be reported as a summary:

```[OK]: All power supplies (2) are in good condition|'ps_1'=122 'ps_2'=109```

If multiline output by default is preferred the option ```--detailed``` needs to be added
```
[OK]: Power supply 1 (865408-B21) status is: Ok
[OK]: Power supply 2 (865408-B21) status is: Ok|'ps_1'=121 'ps_2'=109
```

### Debugging
Use option ```--verbose``` to check for connection problems.
All redfish https requests and responses will be printed.

### Max option (health checks only)
This option can be used to limit the results output for event log entries requested
by **--mel** and **--sel**

### Log filter option
With `--log_exclude` it is possible to define log messages which will be excluded from monitoring.
This filter uses regex to match log messages. Multiple filters can be defined comma separated. Use quotes to
"escape" messages which include a comma.

Example Usage:
```
--log_exclude = '"log message, with a comma", another log message, user .* logged in'
```
Example result:
```

```

### Timeout and Retries
Sometimes an iLO4 BMC can be very slow in answering Redfish request. To avoid getting "retries exhausted"
alarms you can increase the number of retries and/or the timeout. The timeout defines the seconds after each
try/retry times out. If you increase these values make sure to also adjust the ```check_timeout``` setting
in your [Icinga2 service definition](contrib/icinga2_hw_service_checks_example.conf). The total runtime of
this plugin (if all retries fail) can be calculated like this: (1. try + num retries) * timeout

The default number of retries is set to 3 and the default timeout is set to 7. In case all retries fail then
the plugin would be finished after 28 seconds.

```(1 + 3) * 7 = 28```

## Inventory data
This plugin is able to return a (almost) complete inventory of the queried system.
Just add the command option ```--inventory``` or ```-i``` to get the inventory
in a JSON format.

**IMPORTANT**<br>
This is the first official version and might still change later on. If you encounter problems or have
suggestions for changes/improvements then please create a GitHub issue.

### Verbose output
In case you need more information or want to debug the data you can add the verbose
option. This will also add the `source_data` attribute for each inventory item.

### Inventory attributes
You can find a list of attributes for each item [here](cr_module/classes/inventory.py#L182)

### Inventory file
It is also possible to use the cli option `--inventory_file` to write the inventory data to a file.
This way it can be forwarded or used in an inventory import tool. Here you also might want to use
`--inventory_id` to get a fixed reference to an existing object.

## Known limitations
* On HPE iLO4 a maximum of 30 entries will be returned for the commands
**--mel** and **--sel**
* On almost all systems the nic status is reported unreliable
* For **--storage** components which report a Status.Health as **None**
will be treated as **OK** if Status.State is set to **Enabled**
